Introduction
============

This project is an immersive environment designs to run in a CAVE Virtual Environment (Thats Virtual Reality to anyone not in accademia or lived through the 90s ;). It is written in the S3D scripting langauge (not assembly) and runs on the XVR virtual machine as used in the UCL CS Cave. The XVR VM implements a subset of the full OpenGL instruction set.

The project allows the user to select from a series of models and manipulate them in the CAVE 3D space around them, using the wand device. Alternatively blocks can be resized and textured. Basic gravity and collision detection has been implemented.

Usage / Compilation
===================

The project will run on the version of the VM stored in the repository, although if you have access to a CAVE it will look substantially better.
